                      <strong>A* ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION ON ROBOT MOVEMENT SYSTEM IN THE WAREHOUSE.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In 2017, I was looking for a research topic for my final project, until one condition I started research with ideas that came from two large multinational companies, namely: Amazon and Alibaba. The news headline that I
                      read at that time was about a warehousing robot that sends goods from a point starting with preparation for shipment and being delivered to the point of destination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As an electrical engineering student in the control system field, I tried to try to realize this idea with the help of my supervisor. I, who at that time liked the MOBA game DotA 2, thought of a situation where a
                      character could move independently by selecting the fastest route and being able to identify obstacles or routes that could not be passed. So, the combination of ideas comes how a robot can determine the shortest route
                      from all possible routes that can be passed and can avoid obstacles. To be able to determine the shortest route, we need an algorithm that can be mathematically implemented to the conditions on the robot so that it can
                      solve problems in finding the shortest route.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At that time, an algorithm named A* (A Star) was chosen based on a simple method that can fulfill a mathematical function and can be implemented in a robot to find the shortest route independently. In a route search
                      process, there is an important variable, namely position. The position is a reference parameter for the robot to move precisely with the specified conditions so that it can find out how the robot can move with the
                      shortest route. In identifying the position to be used by the robot, the supervisor suggests using visible light communication (VLC) technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      VLC is a communication system technology that uses visible light as a form of information signal. Of course, VLC can be implemented in my final project research by utilizing LED lights which function as lighting
                      devices in rooms such as in warehousing, obviously as the main function as lighting can also be used as identification of a position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To be able to move at a certain speed, the design of a wheeled robot is realized to be able to test the robot's ability to move and choose the shortest route based on the position of the lights, each of which has an
                      identity with a certain scheme. During the testing process, a 2x2 and 3x3 lamp mapping scheme was used referring to the grid-world mapping. In the process of mapping and placing the specified position, testing is
                      carried out on the robot to move from the position of the starting point to the specified destination point. The test results show that the design of a robot in which the A* algorithm is implemented with a position
                      mapping using a lamp that has been implemented by VLC can move to find the shortest route out of all possible routes that can be passed based on the specified destination point.

                      <strong>PATH PLANNING MODELING AND ARCHITECTURE DESIGN FOR Q-LEARNING ALGORITHM USING FPGA.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In 2020 I started my master's degree in microelectronics engineering, and for that, I needed a topic for my thesis. After I asked several lecturers about the availability of the topic, and at that time one of the
                      prospective supervisors offered the topic of FPGA-based edge computing with several types of problems, including path-planning processes, tic-tac-toe games, and electronic amplifier circuits. At that time, I without
                      hesitation chose the path-planning process as the topic of my thesis. The idea for this topic is, how fast is the computational process in determining the route needed as a solution to a problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The idea of the problem came from this need and came from the speed in rescuing victims of natural disasters, such as in the case of victims of natural disasters who were trapped in a cave with different environmental
                      conditions. The speed of the search process becomes very crucial during this crisis. The design of a hardware accelerator is defined as a solution and research objective to accelerate the computational process of
                      finding the shortest route.

                      Before designing a hardware accelerator for the process of finding the shortest route, several steps are needed such as determining the algorithm in determining the shortest route. After conducting several literature
                      studies, the Q-learning algorithm from Reinforcement Learning was determined as a mathematical algorithm for systematically determining the shortest route.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Next, a model design is carried out to implement the q-learning algorithm in solving the shortest route search problem. Model design is done with MATLAB and applies several provisions such as the mapping scheme used,
                      the number of episodes and maximum steps per episode as a learning process, learning rate parameters and discount factors, determining exploration and exploitation methods, reward design, as well as the initial
                      position, destination position, position and the number of obstacles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After all, parameters are set, modeling can be simulated to get the results of the agent's learning process in determining the shortest route. After doing the modeling, the results of the modeling program are converted
                      into RTL architectural designs by reducing the complexity of the q-learning equation to get more optimal results in calculating accumulated rewards. The RTL architectural design was written using the Verilog
                      programming language on the Vivado application using the Zybo-7 FPGA board. The next process is design verification with the synthesis process and design implementation to get the bitstream. After getting the
                      bitstream, the next process is implementing the FPGA to test the design results on the Xilink SDK using the FPGA board.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      From the results of the modeling and implementation of the hardware, then an evaluation of the system design results is carried out and compares the model simulation time and the implementation of the design
                      architecture on the hardware. It was found that the computing speed on the hardware was 763 times faster than the model with the results of determining the optimal shortest route in the same case.

                    <p>
                      ReRAM consists of an array of several resistive elements (RE) configured within a transistor cell (1T1R). RE has a stacked film structure supporting stable resistive switching in a Conductive Filament with Oxygen
                      Vacancy formed. Oxygen Vacancy is created by firing a powerful ion+. The firing of ion + in a few minutes can remove some of the oxygen atoms. With a high coordination number of Cation than the Anion in the RE lattice,
                      the firing of ion+ in a few minutes can remove some of the oxygen atoms closest to the center of the cell.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Most ReRAM solutions have been evaluated to be integrated or embedded in CMOS technology nodes with the same silicon substrate. This implementation eliminates the need for external memory components, thereby increasing
                      data retention, also reducing latency and power consumption. The challenge in embedded ReRAM fabrication is integrating RE fabrication into a sophisticated low-k BEOL process. The size and shape of the RE are designed
                      to allow the filling of low-k gaps with limited cell area. Optimal RE etching method is needed to minimize etching damage on the RE side, excessive etching of the lower intermetallic dielectric (IMD), and corrosion of
                      the metal layer under the RE.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Benchmark Characteristics from ReRAM, There are Low Power, High Performance, and Low Cost. In sleep rate, ReRAM is the best data buffer that doesn't consume any power at all but with the use of ReRAM as a data buffer
                      in an active state, ReRAM is still inferior to other devices that can provide faster and more stable performance. ReRAM for embedded plays a role in the development of OTP memory into RW-OTP memory to compete with MTP
                      in terms of function by maintaining good retention and endurance. The use of polyamide on electrodes when forming TFT makes the devices low-cost.
